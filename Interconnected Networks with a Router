Project: Interconnecting Two Networks Using a Router

Configured two separate networks using different subnets (192.168.1.0/24 & 192.168.2.0/24).
Used a router to enable communication between both networks.
Set up static routing to ensure proper packet forwarding.
Tested network connectivity using Ping and Packet Tracer simulations.
